After spending 3 months learning about refrigerators and other boring shit, he decided that his awesomeness could be better put to use as an Electrical & Computer Engineer.

									<p>In just 3 months, he managed to publically insult the Queen of Palau, spend $2,500 on food, learn to wakeboard by shredding through a national heritage site, and single handedly save a financial organization from shutting down. They are eternally grateful for the awesomeness that is the work of Josh Antonson.</p>

									<p>5 weeks later, Josh led his team to qualify for nationals at the Regional XC meet off of sheer willpower, talent, and awesomeness. 1 week after that, he ran the fastest 8k of his life at the National XC Meet to help his team place 18th.</p>
